Prediction
Suppose we want to know the predicted value ^y at x = 30. Could
write out the equation using the parameter estimates and ll in the
required value for x:
19.94379 + 2.07497*30
[1] 82.19289
Alternatively, could use the predict function:
predict(model,list(x=30))
1
82.19289
%=============================%
For linear plots use abline for superimposing the model on a
scatterplot of the data points. For curved responses, use the
predict function to generate the lines.

\subsection*{Confidence and Prediction Intervals}
Fitted lines are often presented with uncertainty bands around
them. There are two types of bands:
\item Confidence bands - refer to the POPULATION.
\item  Prediction bands - refer to an INDIVIDUAL.
One way to get intervals:
predict(model, interval="confidence")
predict(model, interval="prediction")
In order plot the bands on the same plot as the tted line, use the
following:
grid <- seq(5,50)
pi <- predict(model, list(x=grid), interval="prediction")
ci <- predict(model, list(x=grid), interval="confidence")
plot(SLR1$x, SLR1$y, xlab="x", ylab="y")
matlines(grid, pi, lty=c(1,2,2), col=c("black", "blue","blue"))
matlines(grid, ci, lty=c(1,3,3), col=c("black", "red","red"))
legend("bottomright", legend=c("Prediction Interval", "Confidence Interval"),
lty=2:3, col=c("blue","red"), bty="n")
