	\section{Variance and Covariance}
	Covariance is a measure of how much two variables change together. 
	
	Variance can be considered as a special case of the covariance when the two variables are identical.
	$var(x) = cov(X,X)$
	
	Covariance can be computed as product of the variance of two datasets, multiplied by their correlation.
	
	\[
	cov(X,Y) = std.dev (x) std.dev(y) cor(x,y)
	\]
	
	A covariance matrix is a useful tool for assessing variances in multiple data sets.
	
	
	If X and Y are independent, then their covariance is zero. However it is possible for X and Y to have covariance zero when they are not independent.
