bi: Slope estimate for variable i
Constant . 

Although the b0 and the several bi values are all estimates of
parameters in the regression equation, in most computer output the term constant refers to the value of the b0
intercept. In multiple regression analysis, this is the regression equation value of the dependent variable Y given
that all of the independent variables are equal to zero.
