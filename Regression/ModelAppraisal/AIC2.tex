\section{Information Criterions}
We define two types of information criterion: the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the
Schwarz?s Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The Akaike information criterion is a measure
of the relative goodness of fit of a statistical model.
\[AIC = 2p - 2 ln(L)\]


%=================================================%
\begin{itemize}
	\item p is the number of predictor variables in the model.
	\item L is the value of the Likelihood function for the model in question.
	\item For AIC to be optimal, n must be large compared to p.
\end{itemize}

An alternative to the AIC is the Schwarz BIC, which additionally takes into account the
sample size n.
\[BIC = p ln n - 2 ln(L)\]
When using the AIC (or BIC) for selecting the optimal model, we choose the model for which
the AIC (or BIC) value is lowest.
