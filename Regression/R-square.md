The Coefficient of Determination 
===================================================
 
The coefficient of determination, R-squared, is a measure of the proportion of variability explained by, or due to the regression (linear relationship) in a 
sample of bivariate (i.e. X v Y) data. It is a number between zero and one and a value close to zero suggests a poor model. 
 
A very high value of R-squared can arise even though the relationship between the two variables is non-linear. The fit of a model should never simply be 
judged from the R-squared value. 
 
In the case of simple linear regression (i.e. bivariate data) the coefficient of determination is equivalent to the square of the correlation coefficient 
of X and Y. 
 
In the case of MLR, the coefficient of determination is derived from Sums of Squares Identities (material we will cover soon). 
 
The R-squared value is presented as part of the output of the summary command for a fitted model.
