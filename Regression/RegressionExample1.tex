A fire insurance company wants to relate the amount of fire damage in major residential fires to the distance between the residence and the nearest fire station. The study is to be conducted in a large suburb of a major city; a sample of 15 recent fires in this suburb is selected. The amount of damage (thousands of pounds) and the distance (in Kilometers) between the fire and the nearest station are recorded for each fire. 
Distance (X)  3.4   1.8    4.6    2.3    3.1    5.5    0.7    3.0    2.6    4.3    2.1    1.1    6.1    4.8   3.8 
Fire Damage (Y)   21    13     26     18     23     31     9       17     15     26     19     12     38     31    21    

(i)   Illustrate the data in a scatter diagram. 4 

(ii)  Compute the value of the correlation coeffcient. 6 

(iii) Using a significance level of a = 0.05, test the claim that there is no linear      correlation  between distance and fire damage.  6 

(iv)  Find the equation of the regression line and plot the regression line on the scatter  diagram. Interpret the equation. 5 

(v)  Estimate the amount of fire damage if the distance between the fire and the  nearest  fire station is four miles. 4 

Note that 
S x = 49.2 
S y = 320 
S x 2 = 196.16 
S y 2 = 7722 
S xy = 1219.2
