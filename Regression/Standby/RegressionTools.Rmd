```{r}
library(MASS)
library(MethComp)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
Model1 <- lm(stack.loss ~ ., stackloss)

Model2 <- rlm(stack.loss ~ ., stackloss)

plot(Model1,which=c(3))
```
```{r}
summary(Model1)
```
```{r}
plot(Model1)
```
```{r}
rlm(stack.loss ~ ., stackloss, psi = psi.hampel, init = "lts")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
