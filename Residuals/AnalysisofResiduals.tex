\subsection{Analysis of residuals}
Perform an analysis of regression residuals ( you can pick the best regression model from last section).
Are the residuals normally distributed?
	Histogram /  Boxplot / QQ plot / Shapiro Wilk Test
Also you can plot the residuals to check that there is constant variance.
\begin{verbatim}
y=rnorm(10)
x=rnorm(10)
fit1=lm(y~x)
res.fit1 = resid(fit1)
plot(res.fit1)
\end{verbatim}
